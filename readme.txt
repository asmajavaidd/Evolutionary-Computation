In order to run the program for different set of equation you need to go to start.java file
and change the values of the coefficients that is varconstx, varconsty, varconstz. You also need 
to change the values of vara, varb, varc for the equation you are considering. Set the domain 
for the given set of equations like in our examples we set the domain [0,20].
